# Lamb-microbiome-study
This repository contains R scripts and supporting files for a small-scale microbiome study investigating the gastrointestinal bacterial communities of lambs grazing different pasture types. This repository serves as a documentation of a study-specific analysis protocol (rather than a reusable R package or set of functions).

About the Study
The goal of this study was to examine how pasture composition, sampling time, and parasitic burden (egg counts of Nematodirus battus and strongyles) influence lamb gut microbiota (GM) composition and diversity. Statistical analyses were carried out in R version 4.3.2.
